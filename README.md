In Milestone 3, we are focusing on creating a well-organized structure for the backend of a web application. The goal is to organize our code in a way that makes it easier to maintain and scale over time. Here's a brief explanation of key components:

**Backend Folder Structure:**

Routes: This folder will hold all the endpoints of your application (e.g., /users, /products). Routes define the paths users or clients can visit and what happens when they do.

Controllers: These are responsible for handling the logic for each route. Controllers interact with models, process data, and send responses back to the user.

Models: These represent the structure of the data you're working with, typically related to your database. For example, a User model would define how user data is stored and interacted with.

Middleware: Middleware functions are executed before the final route handler. They can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, or input validation. Think of them as layers that "sit" between the request and the response.
Additional Concepts:

Utils: This refers to utility functions that provide helpful, reusable code for common tasks, like formatting dates or parsing data.
Middlewares: As mentioned, they act as intermediaries between the incoming request and the route handler. They're useful for tasks like checking if the user is logged in or validating inputs.
The structure helps you build clean, modular, and reusable code, which makes development smoother as your application grows. The concepts of routes, controllers, models, and middleware will become clearer as you implement them in your project.
