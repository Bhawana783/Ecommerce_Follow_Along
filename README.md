# Ecommerce_Follow_Along

# Milestone-1
created readme.md[text]
 In this milestone, we begin the exciting journey of building an e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application from scratch.

 ### Key Features of the Project
In this project, we will be building a fully functional e-commerce platform with the following features:

### REST API Creation: Learn how to build scalable and efficient APIs for handling user authentication, product management, and order processing.
### Authentication: Implement secure login and registration functionalities for users.
### Database Schema Design: Design and implement MongoDB schemas to structure the data for users, products, and orders.
Backend Development: Set up a robust server-side application using Node.js and Express.js.

Frontend Development: Use React.js to create the user interface for browsing products, registering users, and making purchases.
Core Concepts Covered

In this milestone, we will focus on understanding and implementing:

MERN Stack Overview: Introduction to the technologies used in the MERN stack and how they integrate to build a full-stack application.

REST API Structure and Endpoints: Learn how to create RESTful APIs to handle requests for user authentication, product data, and orders.

Database Schema Design: Understand how to structure the data in MongoDB using schemas for users, products, and orders.

User Authentication: Implement authentication functionality, ensuring that users can securely log in and access restricted resources.
# Milestone-3
In Milestone 3, we are focusing on creating a well-organized structure for the backend of a web application. The goal is to organize our code in a way that makes it easier to maintain and scale over time. Here's a brief explanation of key components:

**Backend Folder Structure:**

Routes: This folder will hold all the endpoints of your application (e.g., /users, /products). Routes define the paths users or clients can visit and what happens when they do.

Controllers: These are responsible for handling the logic for each route. Controllers interact with models, process data, and send responses back to the user.

Models: These represent the structure of the data you're working with, typically related to your database. For example, a User model would define how user data is stored and interacted with.

Middleware: Middleware functions are executed before the final route handler. They can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, or input validation. Think of them as layers that "sit" between the request and the response.
Additional Concepts:

Utils: This refers to utility functions that provide helpful, reusable code for common tasks, like formatting dates or parsing data.
Middlewares: As mentioned, they act as intermediaries between the incoming request and the route handler. They're useful for tasks like checking if the user is logged in or validating inputs.
The structure helps you build clean, modular, and reusable code, which makes development smoother as your application grows. The concepts of routes, controllers, models, and middleware will become clearer as you implement them in your project.

# Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page

## Overview
In this milestone, I focused on building the sign-up page for users to register. The page includes fields for the userâ€™s full name, email, and password. After users fill out the form, their inputs are validated to ensure they meet the required criteria before submission.

## Key Features
- **Sign-Up Form**: A user-friendly sign-up form with fields for the name, email, and password.
- **Form Validation**: Input validation for name, email format, and password strength (minimum 6 characters).
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
